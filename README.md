# Trivia!

## Guidelines & Requirements for this Project

Created for the Tandem Apprenticeship Program! The basic goal for this project is to create a trivia app from the provided questions. A player can view the questions and multiple choice answer options, the correct answer on submission, and their score.

### Assumptions

A round of trivia has 10 questions. Everything is multiple choice. The score does not have to update in real time - results can update on form submit, button click, or any other interaction.

### Acceptance Criteria

A user can view questions one at a time, all multiple choice. Questions should not repeat in a round. A user can only select one answer at a time from the provided possibilities. The correct answer must be revealed after the user has submitted their answer. Users can see their score at the end of the round.

## Available Scripts

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:8080> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
